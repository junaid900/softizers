	width:1600px; /* This is the width you want to be displayed for IE6 users. Remember IE6 can't handle fluid layouts, so it has to be fixed. Change it to: 960, 1200, 1440, 1600 (recommended ofc). Now under #content, declare the width with minus 330 from this value. I used 1600 here so the content is 1600 - 330 = 1270 */
